The Translate project has the post-build event listed below attached to it.  Basically what this will do is compile the application 
using the config file that matches the current configuration.  For example if you compile the application using the "Debug"
configuration your App.config file will be created using the Debug.config.  The same goes for release, the app.config
will be compiled using the Release.config.  If other configuration's are needed just add another configuraton in the 
Configuration Manager and then create the matching .config file.
